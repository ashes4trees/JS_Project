# Back to Breath

## Background
For those of us who spend a lot of time at our desks, finding brief moments of calm throughout the day are crucial. This project aims to provide a digital destressing space for users, with a scenic landscape including whimsical animations, meditative music, and visual prompts to help slow breathing. 

## Functionality & MVPs
* In Back to Breath, users will be able to:
* Select their preferred music 
* Select a length of time for their “meditation”
* Match their breathing to a repetitive visual cue
* Click on items within the canvas to trigger animations
* Change, pause, play the music and adjust volume

In addition, this project will include:
* A production README

## Wireframes

The user will first be prompted to select music and time, then the image will render.
Music controls will be on the right.
Nav links will include links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and portfolio.


## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
